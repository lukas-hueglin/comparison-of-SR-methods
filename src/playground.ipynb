All these methods are based on multilayer perceptrons and trained with images from the [Unsplash Dataset](https://unsplash.com/data). The Code for building the models, training and validating them is located in the [super_resolution](./super_resolution/) directory. These modules and the tensorflow libraries are imported in the following."
